How to run My Brewery List:

Upon the page loading, a list of brewery names fetched from Open Brewery DB will populate.

Each Brewery name will be a clickable link. When clicked, the page will show you additional information about the brewery that you clicked.

Once you are done reading additional information on the specific brewery you have clicked, the 'All Breweries' button will bring you back to the list of all breweries.
